## "Museum Explorer" | Thinkful API Capstone
Museum Explorer is designed for everyone from art enthusiasts to families looking to see what their local museums hold. It compiles digital information and online content for each museum, allowing the user to browse museums on map (by location) or gives the option to view featured museums.

## User Cases
This app is for three types of users.
(As a user...I want to...In order to achieve....)
1. As an art enthusiast, I want to gather digital Art Resources in order to view all the resources in one place.
2. As a budget strapped tourist, I want to know what features are already available virtually in order to "travel" at home on my computer.
3. As a patron of local businesses, I want to know what Museums are in my area and what features they have in order to best evaluate how to spend my time and money.

* The app


## Technology
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery

* The app uses AJAX JSON calls to the <a href="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api">Google Maps</a> Open Platform API, including the Places Library, to return an interactive map to search for Museums in a given area with clickable icons, which return Place Details for each museum result.
* The app uses AJAX JSON calls to the YouTube V3 Data API to find Museum's channels and display a list of videos from that channel.

## Responsive
App is built to be responsive across mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screen resolutions.

## Development Roadmap
This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:
* A better interface for non-English speaking users, including search-specific language translators to ensure all availble digital content (i.e. YouTube Channel) is displayed.
